# File Organizer

This Python script organizes files in the user's downloads folder into categorized subfolders based on their file types. It's portable across operating systems and efficiently utilizes the `shutil` and `pathlib` libraries for file management.

2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Run the script using the command `python PyFileMover.py`.

## Description

The script automatically detects the user's downloads folder in any operating system and creates category folders for images, documents, videos, music, and others. Files are then moved to their respective folders based on their file extensions. If any errors occur during the file movement process, they are handled gracefully.
